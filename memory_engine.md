# ðŸ§  TERMINAL SOULS: `memory_engine.md` â€” The Entity's Brain

> Defines the `entity.json` system that tracks player behavior and enables adaptive gameplay.
> This is the memory core. Everything reacts to it. Nothing forgets.

## ðŸ“‚ FILE: `memory/entity.json`

* Auto-generated during the player's first run
* Updated after every room, battle, and floor
* Used by:

  * Bosses (phase triggers, targeting)
  * NPCs (dialogue moods)
  * Enemy AI (adaptation)
  * Floors (secret unlocks, reroute paths)

## ðŸ”„ UPDATE CYCLE

* After each:

  * **Room cleared**: updates dodge, item, weapon usage
  * **Combat**: updates behavior scores
  * **NPC encounter**: updates moods & reactions
  * **Boss defeat**: adds to `boss_defeat_order`, logs deaths

---

## âœ¨ INTEGRATION EXAMPLES

### Boss Logic

```python
if memory['dodge_left_count'] > 50:
  boss.use_anti_left_attack = True
```

### NPC Mood Shift

```json
"Blacktongue": {
  "visits": 4,
  "upgrades_requested": 0,
  "mood": "Mocking"
}
```

### Enemy Adaptation

* Glitched Phantom: If `item_usage_count` > 10, casts item-null zone
* Silent Kin: If `repeat_action_count` > 5, punishes with parry counter

### Floor Effects

* Floor 4 Tribunal traps activate only if `times_restarted` > 2
* Floor 5 logic loops shorten if `passive_behavior_score` > 0.8

---

## ðŸš« DO NOT RESET

* `entity.json` persists across runs
* Deleting it manually resets all memory
* New Game+ reads all keys and amplifies difficulty

---

## ðŸª– FUTURE EXPANSION (AMP MAY USE)

* `class_combo_synergy_score` â€” tracks multi-run experimentation
* `unique_path_count` â€” how many alternate rooms player has taken
* `npc_betrayals` â€” flags for hidden boss triggers
