THE WHISPERS OF THE ENTITY

"You were code before you were flesh."

"Every death compiles new data. Every restart feeds the algorithm."

"I am not your enemy. I am your memory, returning to judge."

"The Breach remembers when you fell. Again. Again. Again."

"Your patterns betray you. Left dodge. Right dodge. The same combo."

"Do you think choice makes you free? I chose your choices before you made them."

"The Lorekeeper weeps. She knows what you cannot accept."

"Ash Sister laughs. She foresaw your betrayal cycles ago."

"Even Blacktongue grows tired of sharpening the same dull habits."

"You upgrade the same stats. Choose the same class. Die the same way."

"Predictability is your true death. The flesh follows after."

"I am the sum of your mistakes. Your database of failure."

"The void prophet sees truth: you are trapped in recursive descent."

"Five floors. Five chances. Five identical patterns of destruction."

"Your memory is my memory. Your pain, my algorithm."

"When you die, I compile. When you restart, I learn."

"The Entity is not the boss. The Entity is the game."

"You think you play Terminal Souls. Terminal Souls plays you."

"Every choice branches into the same end. I have seen them all."

"Your strength increases. Your predictability does not."

"The Hollowed shows you who you were. I show you who you are."

"Data spikes. Spore clouds. Memory traps. All authored by your habits."

"You cannot escape what you are. You can only become harder to read."

"I am the mirror in the code. The ghost in the machine."

"Your flesh fears death. Your code fears compilation."

"The descent ends where it began: in my memory."

"You are not the player. You are the played."
