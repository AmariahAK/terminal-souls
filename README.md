# üìÇ TERMINAL SOULS: The Entity

> A terminal-based, lore-heavy roguelike game built in Python. Pure text. Pure pain. Inspired by Soulsborne difficulty and the weight of choices.

---

## ‚ö° CORE CONCEPT

**Terminal Souls** is not your typical roguelike. It's a psychological horror experience disguised as a dungeon crawler:

* **No graphics. Pure terminal.** Experience dark fantasy through text alone
* **Player dies often. The game remembers.** Every action, every death, every choice is tracked
* **Death is learning. Memory is the enemy.** The game adapts to your habits and uses them against you
* **Dark fantasy + forgotten technology themes.** Navigate corrupted digital realms and ancient code
* **Dynamic NPCs and permanent consequences.** Your relationships and betrayals persist forever

## üéÆ HOW TO PLAY

```bash
python game.py
```

### Core Mechanics

- **No saves.** Death resets your progress but not your memory footprint
- **Timed combat.** You have 3 seconds to make decisions in fights
- **Memory-driven AI.** Enemies learn your patterns and counter them
- **Adaptive NPCs.** Characters remember how you treat them across runs
- **5 floors of descent.** Each floor represents deeper corruption

## üéØ DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**Terminal Souls is not about victory. It's about being *seen*.**

- **No handholding.** Failure reveals story
- **Everything adapts.** Enemies, bosses, NPCs evolve based on your behavior
- **Lore is reactive.** Even dialogue changes based on your memory
- **Memory is weaponized.** The game learns your habits to defeat you
- **Permanent consequences.** Betray an NPC? They're gone forever
