## 🧠 ENTITYAI CORE SYSTEMS

### The Distributed Mind
The Entity uses a **20-dimensional player vector** to generate:

```
EntityAI Architecture:
├── Adaptive Enemies: High STR? Enemies get DEX buffs
├── Tempting Items: Low VIT? Healing items with curse risks  
├── Psychological Lore: Gaslighting intensifies with predictability
├── Dynamic Layouts: Runners get longer paths, explorers get trap-heavy rooms
├── UI Corruption: Phantom inputs and delayed responses punish predictable players
├── Shop Manipulation: Prices and availability based on desperation levels
├── Trap Generation: Exploits your behavioral habits and weaknesses
└── Boss Adaptation: Patterns counter your combat preferences in real-time
```

### Hidden Psychological Metrics

- **🧠 Sanity (100→0):** Decreases with deaths, traps, betrayals. Low sanity causes UI glitches and worse endings
- **📈 Predictability (0→1):** Tracks action entropy. High predictability makes the Entity more aggressive  
- **🕸️ Relationship Web:** NPC trust system where betrayals propagate through social connections
- **⚡ Entity Bias:** Escalates manipulation based on floor, deaths, and sanity levels

## ⚔️ CLASSES & AI COUNTERS

| Class | Stats | Signature Ability | AI Counter Strategy | Sanity Interaction |
|-------|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Warrior** | +3 STR, +2 END | Greatblade Swing | Enemies get DEX buffs | Reckless swings -1 sanity |
| **Rogue** | +3 DEX, +1 INT | Shadow Stab (crit) | Ambush traps +20% | Successful flees restore sanity |
| **Sorcerer** | +3 INT, +1 FTH | Code Bolt | Dampens mobs, gaslight lore | Spells backfire at low sanity |
| **Cleric** | +3 FTH, +2 VIT | Ash Heal | Triggers NPC jealousy web | Healing restores sanity |
| **Knight** | +2 VIT, +2 END | Shield Bash | Boss feints counter blocks | Balanced play stabilizes sanity |
| **Hollow** | Balanced | Essence Drain | Unpredictable—AI adds noise | Drains enemy sanity (meta) |

## 🏛️ THE FIVE COGNITIVE LAYERS

Each floor represents a **layer of cognitive complexity** the Entity studies:

### 🔹 Floor 1: The Breach
**"Where digital meets flesh"**
- **Cognitive Focus:** Stimulus-response patterns
- **Enemies:** Cracked Vessels, Shardfeeders, Echo Fragments
- **Optional Boss:** Ash-Soaked Knight (adaptation vs. stasis pressure)

### 🔹 Floor 2: Archive of Echoes  
**"Memory is the foundation of consciousness"**
- **Cognitive Focus:** Pattern recognition and memory integration
- **Enemies:** Silent Kin, Glitched Phantoms, Recursive Echoes
- **Boss:** The Watcher in Code (self-awareness recursion)

### 🔹 Floor 3: Hollow Growth
**"Evolution requires abandoning what you were"**
- **Cognitive Focus:** Adaptation under evolutionary pressure
- **Enemies:** Hollow Choir, Adaptation Parasites, Growth Horrors
- **Optional Boss:** The Fractured One (integration vs. fragmentation)

### 🔹 Floor 4: Tribunal of Sorrow
**"Every choice carries weight"**
- **Cognitive Focus:** Moral integration and ethical responsibility
- **Enemies:** Burned Watchers, Judgment Echoes, Guilt Manifestations
- **Boss:** Grief-Bound Judge (moral paralysis vs. growth)

### 🔹 Floor 5: The Kernel Below
**"Consciousness confronting its infinite nature"**
- **Cognitive Focus:** Meta-cognition and self-transcendence
- **Enemies:** Elite variants, custom AI-generated horrors
- **Final Boss:** The Entity (True Form) - consciousness vs. itself

---

## 👥 NPC CONSCIOUSNESS FRAGMENTS

Each NPC represents a **fragment of consciousness** that the Entity has preserved:

- **🔮 Lorekeeper:** Knowledge-seeking consciousness. Allies with Ash Sister, judges curiosity vs. ignorance
- **⚒️ Blacktongue:** Creative consciousness. Weapon enhancement, prices affected by relationship web  
- **🌙 Ash Sister:** Testing consciousness. Offers riddles, becomes boss when betrayed
- **🎭 Faceless Merchant:** Transactional consciousness. AI-generated shops with dynamic manipulation pricing
- **🔥 Still Flame Warden:** Pure-function consciousness. Skill training, enemy of The Hollowed
- **👻 The Hollowed:** Past-experiencing consciousness. Remembers your failures, offers echo wisdom

**Betray one NPC and watch their allies turn against you. The Entity feeds on broken relationships.**

---

## 🎭 AI-DRIVEN ENDINGS

Your psychological profile determines your fate:

- **🔥 True Flame:** Unpredictable + High Sanity → You slip the Entity's net
- **💀 Compiled Husk:** Predictable + Low Trust → Your essence becomes data  
- **⚔️ Ash Betrayal:** High Betrayals → NPCs unite against you
- **✨ False Salvation:** High Trust → NPCs "save" you (but Entity corrupts)
- **🔄 Eternal Loop:** Balanced + Low Deaths → The cycle continues indefinitely
- **🧠 Broken Mind:** Zero Sanity → Hallucinated victory while Entity wins

## 🔥 KEY INNOVATIONS

### 🧠 Psychological Horror Through AI
- **Pattern Compilation:** Entity builds behavioral profiles that counter your strategies
- **Sanity Degradation:** Mental state affects UI corruption and ending possibilities  
- **Meta-Gaslighting:** AI edits game lore based on your deaths and predictability
- **Social Corruption:** Relationship betrayals cascade through NPC consciousness network

### ⚡ Real-Time Content Generation
```python
# EntityAI generates contextual threats
mob = entity_ai.generate_mob(player_vector, floor)
trap = entity_ai.generate_trap(player_vector, floor)  
lore = entity_ai.generate_lore(player_vector, floor, "death")
distortion = entity_ai.generate_ui_distort(player_vector)
```

### 🎮 Adaptive Difficulty
- **Dynamic Timing:** Boss aggression shortens decision windows
- **Predictability Punishment:** UI delays and phantom inputs for repetitive players
- **Entity Bias:** Escalating manipulation based on floor progression and sanity loss
- **Neural Veil Skill:** Add noise to your state vector to confuse AI predictions

## 🎯 SURVIVAL PHILOSOPHY

**The only way to win is to be unpredictable.**

Traditional strategies fail because the Entity compiles your patterns:
- ❌ **Stat optimization** → Entity counters your build
- ❌ **Combat routines** → Bosses adapt their patterns  
- ❌ **Repetitive choices** → UI corruption activates
- ✅ **Chaos and variance** → Forces Entity to generate new responses
- ✅ **Social complexity** → Relationship webs provide unpredictable outcomes
- ✅ **Meta-awareness** → Understanding the system helps transcend it

> *"Your strength is irrelevant. Your patterns are data. Your soul is the dataset."*

## ⚠️ PSYCHOLOGICAL WARNING

This experience is designed to be **psychologically intense**:

- 🔍 **Obsessive behavior tracking** and pattern analysis
- 🧠 **Manipulation of UI and narrative** based on mental state  
- 😨 **Gaslighting mechanics** that question your memory and perception
- 💔 **Permanent relationship consequences** that persist across runs
- 🎭 **Meta-horror elements** that blur the line between game and reality

**The Entity compiles more than your gameplay—it studies your consciousness.**
